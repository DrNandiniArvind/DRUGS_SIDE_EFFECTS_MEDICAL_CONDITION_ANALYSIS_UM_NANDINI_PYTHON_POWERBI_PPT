# DRUGS_SIDE_EFFECTS_MEDICAL_CONDITION_ANALYSIS_UM_NANDINI_PYTHON_POWERBI_PPT

**OBJECTIVE :**
- The goal is to analyze the relationships between drugs, their side effects, and the
medical conditions they treat, as well as to explore the ratings and reviews
associated with these drugs.


**TOOLS REQUIRED:**
- Python: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: To write and run Python code.

**CONCLUSION:**
- This project involved comprehensive data preprocessing and analysis of a pharmaceutical dataset, ensuring accuracy through cleaning, tokenization, and standardization.
- Using descriptive statistics, data visualization, association rule mining, decision tree classification, and K-means clustering, the analysis provided critical insights into the relationships between drugs, medical conditions, and user ratings.
- These findings equip pharmaceutical companies to:
 1. Optimize drug offerings.
 2. Enhance safety measures.
 3. Tailor strategies to align with consumer preferences, fostering improved healthcare outcomes.
